# Find minimum number of coins to make a given value (Coin Change)

Given an array coins[] of size N and a target value V, where coins[i] represents the coins of 
different denominations. You have an infinite supply of each of coins. The task is to 
find minimum number of coins required to make the given value V. 
If itâ€™s not possible to make a change, print -1.

Example:
Input: coins[] = {9, 6, 5, 1}, V = 11
Output: Minimum 2 coins required We can use one coin of 6 cents and 1 coin of 5 cents

This problem is a variation of the Coin Change Problem. 
Here instead of finding the total number of possible solutions, we need to find 
the solution with the minimum number of coins.
