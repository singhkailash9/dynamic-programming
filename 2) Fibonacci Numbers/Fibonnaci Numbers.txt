Problem:
Calculate the nth Fibonacci number.

Description:
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and the subsequent numbers are generated by adding the two previous ones.
The Fibonacci sequence begins: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on, where x, y, and (x+y) represent consecutive terms in the sequence.
