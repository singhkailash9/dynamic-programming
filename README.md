# Dynamic Programming

A repository containing solutions to common dynamic programming questions implemented in C++, Python, and JavaScript.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to popular dynamic programming questions. The questions are chosen from coding interviews and practice exercises, providing a comprehensive resource for those interested in dynamic programming problem-solving.

## Structure
Each directory is dedicated to a specific question and includes C++, Python, and JavaScript implementations. Additionally, there is a text file in every directory containing the description of the question.

## External Resources
For a detailed understanding of dynamic programming, consider exploring the following resources:
- [Dynamic Programming on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)
- [Dynamic Programming on Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/)

## Usage
Feel free to explore the solutions in each language. If you wish to run or test the code, follow the instructions provided in each language's respective directory.

## Note
This repository was created during my learning journey, and the solutions may not be optimal or complete. I welcome feedback and contributions to improve the solutions and provide better explanations.
